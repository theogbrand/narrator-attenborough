Story
If you’re someone who reads a lot of >30page scientific papers, and uses a lot of summarisers to try and understand them, I've been wondering if I'm the only one who feels that they don’t quite work. I've been looking into this for a while, and I've decided to try and build something about it.

Missing key details (false negatives). Still don’t quite understand the paper.

I recently went to this AI conference, was lucky enough to hear the author of the paper explain his paper through a conversation with him.

I found this really interesting because I’ve re-read his paper a couple of times, but never quite got it,

I was wondering if it was possible to create an experience like this with AI, at scale

My goal is to beat: zero shot summarisers, and all the RAG apps derivatives

My belief is: AI is really good at first order insights (using RAG, zero-shot summarisation)
I’m curious to use AI to make it really easy to gain second order insights, especially for domain specific knowledge work (Finance, Medical)
